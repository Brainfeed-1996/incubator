Publicity is _not_ permitted before the podling is accepted by the Incubator PMC.

There are also some restrictions about how podlings can advertise themselves and 
especially around press releases related to podlings.

The link:http://incubator.apache.org/guides/branding.html[Incubator Branding Guide] has more details.
