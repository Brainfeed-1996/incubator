Once the Incubator PMC votes to establish the podling, its infrastructure can be
setup. 

Usually, the champion or incubation mentors drive this process, but it can also be
driven by podling community members if they know how to proceed.

TODO link to detailed instructions, do we have an up-to-date JIRA template for that?
