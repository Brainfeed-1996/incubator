The Apache Incubator provides services to projects which want to enter the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).

It helps those incoming projects (called "podlings") adopt the Apache link:http://apache.org/theapacheway/[style of governance and operation] and guides them to the ASF services available to our projects so they can become top-level ASF projects ("TLPs").

The Incubator delegates a few mentors for each podling, as "on the ground" agents to act as liaisons with the various ASF teams: link:http://incubator.apache.org/whoweare.html#the_incubator_project_management_commitee_pmc[Incubator PMC], link:https://selfserve.apache.org/[Infrastructure team], etc., and facilitates the podling's growth and operations.

Our link:http://incubator.apache.org/cookbook/[cookbook] helps potential podlings decide whether the ASF is a good fit for them and guides them through the steps required to become an ASF podling.
