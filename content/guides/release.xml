Each review item in this list is either required by Foundation-wide policy and would block a release by any Apache

Each Apache release <a

source package</a>.  This package may not contain compiled components (such as
"jar" files) because compiled components are not open source, even if they
were built from open source.

      <p>
A list of possible additional items is
maintained on the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ReleaseChecklist">ReleaseChecklist</a> wiki page.
      </p>

    </section>
    
    <section id="manifest-usage"><title>2013 Alternate Release Procedure</title>
      <p>
This section explains an alternate release procedure established in December 2013, as documented in the Incubator's <a
href="http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html#Releases">incubation policy</a> page.  It is
available only to selected podlings.
      </p>
      <p>
Once a release candidate is ready, the <a
href="http://www.apache.org/dev/release-publishing.html#release_manager">Release Manager</a> creates a <a
href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/release.html#release-manifest-template">Release
Manifest</a> as a plain text file at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/public/trunk/votes/$PODLING and fills in
all initial fields:
      </p>
      <pre>
== Apache Release Manifest ===============================================

Project: Apache Foo
Release Candidate: Apache Foo 1.2.3-incubating RC1
Release Manager: Grace Hopper (ghopper)
PPMC vote thread URL:
Approved by Mentor: 
Usage: http://incubator.apache.org/guides/release.html

== Contents ==============================================================

apache-foo-1.2.3-incubating.zip
apache-foo-1.2.3-incubating.zip.asc
apache-foo-1.2.3-incubating.zip.md5
apache-foo-1.2.3-incubating.zip.sha
      </pre>
      <p>
A [VOTE] thread is started on the podling's dev list in accordance with <a
href="http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html#Releases">Incubator policy on releases</a>.  The
email kicking off the [VOTE] contains a link URL for the Manifest.  While the [VOTE] is in progress, reviewers update
the Manifest accordingly, signing each item with their Apache ID to indicate that they have reviewed it and found it OK.
Comments are optional.
      </p>
      <pre>
== Reviewers and release votes ===========================================

+1 PPMC Grace Hopper (ghopper)
+1 PPMC Niklaus Wirth (nwirth)

== Review Items ==========================================================

1.1 Checksums and PGP signatures are valid.
    Reviewers: ghopper nwirth 

2.1 Build is successful including automated tests.
    Reviewers: ghopper nwirth 
    Comments:
        ghopper: Relay test still broken on Mark II (FOO-35). +1 anyway.
      </pre>
      <p>
Reviewers don't need to look at all items; as long as there's sufficient coverage of each item the release can go out.
To complete the Manifest, it must be approved by a Mentor:
      </p>
      <pre>
Approved by Mentor: Alan Turing (aturing)
      </pre>
      <p>
If the dev list [VOTE] passes, a [VOTE] on general@incubator is called, again
in accordance with Incubator release <a
href="http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html#Releases">policy</a> and again referencing the
Manifest URL.
      </p>
      <p>
Once the voting process concludes -- regardless of success or failure -- the Release Manager archives the Manifest
permanently by moving it from votes/$PODLING/ to votes/$PODLING/archive/.
      </p>

      <section id='release-manifest-template'><title>Release Manifest Template</title>
        <p>
Podlings typically start from the Incubator's <a href="release_manifest.txt">default Release Manifest</a> template,
which contains a <a href="releasemanagement.html#check-list">checklist</a> of review items.  Optionally, a custom
template may be created by augmenting the default Manifest template with additional review items.
