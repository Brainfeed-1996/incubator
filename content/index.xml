      <title>About the Apache Incubator</title>
      <p>The Incubator project is the entry path into
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a> for
projects and codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts. All 
code donations from external organisations and existing external projects
wishing to join Apache enter through the Incubator.</p>
      <p>The Apache Incubator has two primary goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/">legal 
        standards</a></li>
        <li>Develop new communities that adhere to our
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">guiding
        principles</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      <title>About The Apache Software Foundation</title>
      <p>The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and
financial support for a broad range of open source software projects. The
Foundation provides an established framework for intellectual property and
financial contributions that simultaneously limits the potential legal exposure
for the contributors. Through a collaborative and meritocratic development
process, Apache projects deliver enterprise-grade, freely available software
products that attract large communities of users. The pragmatic Apache License
makes it easy for all users, commercial and individual, to deploy Apache
products.</p>
      <p>You can find out <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">more about the ASF</a>.</p>
