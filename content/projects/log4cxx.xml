</title>
      <p>On 2004-11-27, the log4cxx project has been voted in by the Logging
Services PMC to become part of the Logging Services project. It
implements a logging API similar to log4j but in the C++ language.

      <ul>
        <li>2013-12-09: Log4cxx returns to the incubator with a new group of committers as <a href="log4cxx2.html">log4cxx2</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Curt Arnold currently leads the log4cxx effort. He took over from
Michael Catanzariti, project founder, who is temporarily absent on a
year long trip around the world. The Logging Services PMC found this
smooth transition particularly reassuring.
</p>
      <p>Moreover, log4cxx has decided to base its upcoming 0.9.8 "snapshot"
on APR which constitutes yet another excellent sign of its
integration within the ASF.
