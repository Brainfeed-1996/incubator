      <p>"Derby" is a snapshot of the IBM's Cloudscape Java relational
database. IBM is opening the code by contributing it to The Apache
Software Foundation and basing future versions of IBM Cloudscape on
the Apache-managed code.
</p>
      <p>To participate in the Derby podling, you should join the mailing
list. Just send an empty message to

        <em>derby-dev-subscribe@db.apache.org
</em>.

      </p>
      <p>The initial goal of the project while in incubation is to build a
viable developer community around the codebase.
</p>
      <p>The second goal of Derby-in-incubation is to successfully produce a
release. Since Derby is in incubation, such a release would not have
formal standing; it will serve as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate
to the developers' and incubator's satisfaction that this aspect of
the project is health and understood.

      <ul>
        <li>The Apache DB project will own the Derby subproject, and the
subproject will follow the Apache DB PMC's direction. Significant
contributors to this sub-project (for example, after a significant
interval of sustained contribution) will be proposed for commit
access to the codebase.
</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The Derby sub-project's modules will be available as distinct and
discrete downloads.
