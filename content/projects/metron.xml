      <title>Description</title>
<p>Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in
order to offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and
analysis. Metron provides capabilities for log aggregation, full
packet capture indexing, storage, advanced behavioral analytics and
data enrichment, while applying the most current threat-intelligence
information to security telemetry within a single platform.</p>
<p>
Metron can be divided into 4 areas:
<ol>
<li>A mechanism to capture, store, and normalize any type of security
telemetry at extremely high rates. Because security telemetry is
constantly being generated, it requires a method for ingesting the
data at high speeds and pushing it to various processing units for
advanced computation and analytics.</li>
<li>Real time processing and application of enrichments such as threat
intelligence, geolocation, and DNS information to telemetry being
collected. The immediate application of this information to incoming
telemetry provides the context and situational awareness, as well as
the “who” and “where” information that is critical for investigation.</li>
<li>Efficient information storage based on how the information will be used:
<ol>
  <li>Logs and telemetry are stored such that they can be efficiently mined
  and analyzed for concise security visibility</li>
  <li>The ability to extract and reconstruct full packets helps an analyst
  answer questions such as who the true attacker was, what data was
  leaked, and where that data was sent</li>
  <li>Long-term storage not only increases visibility over time, but also
  enables advanced analytics such as machine learning techniques to be
  used to create models on the information. Incoming data can then be
  scored against these stored models for advanced anomaly detection.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>An interface that gives a security investigator a centralized view of
data and alerts passed through the system. Metron’s interface presents
alert summaries with threat intelligence and enrichment data specific
to that alert on one single page. Furthermore, advanced search
capabilities and full packet extraction tools are presented to the
analyst for investigation without the need to pivot into additional
tools.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Big data is a natural fit for powerful security analytics. The Metron
framework integrates a number of elements from the Hadoop ecosystem to
provide a scalable platform for security analytics, incorporating such
functionality as full-packet capture, stream processing, batch
processing, real-time search, and telemetry aggregation. With Metron,
our goal is to tie big data into security analytics and drive towards
an extensible centralized platform to effectively enable rapid
detection and rapid response for advanced security threats.

            <li>Are there three or more independent committers? YES (The legal definition
                of independent is long and boring, but basically it means that there
                is no binding relationship between the individuals, such as a shared
                employer, that is capable of overriding their free will as
                individuals, directly or indirectly.)</li>
