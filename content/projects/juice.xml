        <source>Status report for JuiCE for the Incubator JuiCE is just entering
incubation, and is currently in the process of starting up. We are
currently waiting on CLAs from core developers to enable us to get
started. * is the STATUS file up to date? (also post link) Yes -
http://incubator.apache.org/projects/juice.html * any legal,
cross-project or personal issues that still need to be addressed? No.
* what has been done for incubation since the last report? JuiCE has
only just entered the Incubator. We are currently in the process of
getting infrastructure up and running, accounts set up and code
imported. * plans and expectations for the next period? Getting code
imported, web site setup and development started.

<b>April 2006</b>
</p><p>
Good activity in the previous quarter.  Werner Dittman was voted in as a 
committer and has been refactoring the initial code into a more long 
term format.  A test build has also been created on a Win32 platform.
</p><p>
The team involved in this are all committers on the xml-security project.
Over the next quarter we will be looking to promote this from the 
Incubator into the xml project as a part of xml-security.
