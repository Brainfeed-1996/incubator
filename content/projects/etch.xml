                Etch - a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent
                framework for building and consuming network services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent
              framework for building and consuming network services. The Etch
              toolset includes a network service description language, a compiler,
              and binding libraries for a variety of programming languages. Etch is
              also transport-independent, allowing for a variety of different
              transports to used based on need and circumstance. The goal of Etch is
              to make it simple to define small, focused services that can be easily
              accessed, combined, and deployed in a similar manner. Ultimately with
              Etch, service development and consumption becomes no more difficult
              than library development and consumption.

                                Prior to acceptance there was a great deal of discussion whether
                                Apache Etch would interfere with the Debian Etch distribution. The
                                sceptics meant that Debian Etch is extremely well-known name and 
                                should be avoided. The team defended the position by pointing out
                                that by the time Apache Etch graduates, Debian Lenny has taken 
                                over the world and another year or two the Debian Etch is just a
                                distant memory.
