CloudStack

CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud orchestration platform.

CloudStack has been incubating since 2012-04-16.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation

  1. Continuing to build the community and increase diversity, while effectively managing the overall scale of the project.
  2. Ensuring all deliberation, decision-making, and development is happening openly and collaboratively.
  3. Transfer trademark, etc. to Apache

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The project has continuted to grow and has added several new PPMC members and committers since October:

  - Edison Su, Alex Huang, Hugo Trippaers, and Chiradeep Vittal, have joined the PPMC since October.

  - Rohit Yadav, Marcus Sorensen, Gavin Lee, Sudha Ponnaganti, Kelcey Damage, and Min Chen have become committers.

  Members of the CloudStack community have been active in promoting the project since the last report, with members giving talks about Apache CloudStack at USENIX LISA, CPOSC, ApacheCon EU, LinuxCon EU, and other events. 

  The CloudStack Collaboration Conference (sponsored primarily by Citrix) was a fairly successful first conference. More than 300 people attended the event, held November 30 - December 2 in Las Vegas at The Venetian. 

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The first release, 4.0.0-incubating, was announced on November 6th. 

  The CloudStack.org domain now points to Apache infrastructure. 

  4.0.1 and 4.1.0 are currently in development. The community has decided to work on a time-based release cycle for feature releases, with 4.1.0 expected at the beginning of April. Feature releases will follow a four-month cycle thereafter.

CloudStack

CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud orchestration
platform. CloudStack has been in incubation since 2012-04-16

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Continuing to build the community and increase diversity
  2. Shipping a release
  3. Transfer trademark, etc. to Apache

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The project has continued to improve its diversity, adding
  Chip Childers, John Kinsella, and Wido den Hollander to the PPMC
  and 3 new committers since the month of August. (Mice Xia, Jason
  Bausewein, and Joe Brockmeier.) We have also taken on a new mentor,
  Noah Slater.

  Contributors and committers have been active in promoting CloudStack
  at events, such as LinuxCon, Ohio LinuxFest, PuppetConf, a get-together

CloudStack

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation

  1. Licensing work
  2. Finishing up the move of CloudStack infrastructure resources to the ASF.
  3. Shipping a release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  CloudStack has added 6 new committers in the month of July.

  We had BOF and hackathon time at OSCON, which was a positive benefit for
  those committers who attended, particularly in being able to delve into
  issues around incubation, branding, and licensing. Additionally two
  committers presented tutorials at OSCON one focused on end users deploying
  CloudStack and the other focused on developers hacking on CloudStack, both
  had great attendance.

  We have also had some offers of contribution from people at Bitergia who are
  interested in contributing the work that they have done around metrics. which
  was a very encouraging start to growing the community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Lots of modularization has been injected into CloudStack, which makes some
  of our licensing issues far less of a problem as we can merely turn the
  affected code off by default.

  The wiki has begun migration to an ASF hosted wiki instance.

  One of the CloudStack committers provided a dramatically easier way to be
  able to test and develop for CloudStack in the form a completely contained
  CloudStack environment that can be run as a VirtualBox VM. Much additional
  enhancement has been contributed to this making the process easier and
  easier to update.

  We also saw the movement of documentation from binary .docx files to
  DocBook XML; while this effort isn't complete it does permit folks to far
  more easily collaborate, as well as providing a far better interface
  for l10n.

CloudStack

CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud orchestration
platform. CloudStack has been in incubation since 2012-04-16

The top 3 issues to address to move towards graduation:

  - CloudStack's source still contains works that are prohibited for release
    under ASF guidelines
  - Performing a release
  - Migration of infrastructure (bug tracker, CI, websites, etc)

How has the community developed since the last report:

  As of the time of this report at least one new committer has been added.
  Additionally, a number of previously unknown developers have begun making
  substantial quantities of bugfixes and even working on new functionality.

How has the project developed since the last report:

  The project itself continues to deal with process questions as well as
  learning how to operate in the new environment. A good deal of work has
  been happening on resolving the problems in the code base around licensing,
  though not currently close to finishing.

CloudStack

CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud orchestration
platform. CloudStack has been in incubation since 2012-04-16

CloudStack has been in the incubator for approximately 1.5 months. Mailing
lists have migrated, accounts for the initial committers have been set up,
and the initial code drop/git repo has been setup. Many new names are now
participating in conversations on the mailing lists, with several of them
volunteering to help move things along. The number of submitted patches from
'new names' in the month of May is in the double digits, and range from
trivial one line fixes to two major patches with over 1,000 changed lines
each. The community is beginning to exercise some of its decision making
power by deciding about release tempo, future version schemes and numbers,
and a number of other internal plumbing issues. Much remains to be done in
preparation for the initial release, and those tasks are being identified.
We also have a number of external resources (bug tracker, wiki, CI) that
are still awaiting migration. 

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation

  - The project is using source and binaries with a number of
    non-ASF-approved licenses. This needs remediation.

  - Diversity of the contributor base still needs to be expanded.

  - While we are making progress, there still remains a number of large
    pieces (bug tracker, wiki, test infra) that still need to be migrated
    to ASF infrastructure.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues that we are aware of at this point.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  See the above narration, but generally speaking the community is beginning
  to exercise its decision making powers, largely around internal plumbing
  issues at the moment. We are also seeing a number of new developers
  submitting patches. 

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project continues to have many issues to tackle for its first release
  and is identifying and moving forward on those issues. Work continues on
  solutions to remove the need to massive (or any) amount of additional
  hardware to test/develop with in an effort to lower the barrier to
  participate.

Overview:

  Cloudstack just entered the incubator a couple of weeks ago. Since then,
  the mailing list has been setup  and discussions have started to migrate
  from the existing list to the ASF-hosted list, with several 'new names'
  participating including one of those 'new names' submitting a patch.
  Currently, the code repository and bulk of existing infrastructure is still
  hosted by Citrix, but the community is looking forward to getting that
  moved to Apache as soon as possible.

A list of the most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. The base level of infrastructure migration has begun but still has far
     to be finished. At present the mailing lists exist, but wiki, project
     website, source repository, bug tracker, etc still need to be brought
     up and migrated. In many ways we are blocked on further progress by
     lack of account creation for initial committers.

  2. Diversity of the contributor base still needs to be expanded - this was
     identified as an issue in the proposal, and remains one, though we are
     encouraged by a seeming uptick (we've been in incubation for less than
     a week, so trends are indeed difficult to identify at this point) in
     interest on the mailing lists from previously uninvolved individuals.

  3. The project needs a working process definition.  What is the review
     process for contributions, recommendations for engaging before writing
     large amounts of code, etc.

  4. The project is using source and binaries with a number of
     non-ASF-approved licenses.  This needs remediation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues that we are aware of at this point.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There has been no previous report - so nothing to report here.
