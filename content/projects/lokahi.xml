      <title>Overview</title>
      <div class="section">
        <p>The Apache Lokahi project presents a web based modular framework 
           written in Java to manage both Apache HTTP Server and Apache Tomcat,
           scaling to both horizontal and vertical buildout of these services
           across an enterprise.</p>
        <p>The project originated as TMCg2 at Merck, and was donated to the
           ASF to benefit the broader Apache HTTP Server and Apache Tomcat
           communities.  The name Lokahi (Loh-kah-hee) was chosen as 
           it is the Hawaiian word for "harmony and unity"; one primary goal 
           of the project is to invite ASF technologies to participate in a 
           harmonious configuration framework, unifying configuration and
           deployment of our projects.</p>
