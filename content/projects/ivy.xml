      <title>Description</title>
      <p>
        Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting)
        project dependencies. It is characterized by the following:
      </p>
      <p>
         1. flexibility and configurability - Ivy is essentially process agnostic 
         and is not tied to any methodology or structure. 
         Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability to be 
         adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build processes.
      </p>
      <p> 
         2. tight integration with Apache Ant - while available as a standalone 
         tool, Ivy works particularly well with Apache Ant providing a number of 
         powerful Ant tasks ranging from dependency resolution to dependency 
         reporting and publication.
