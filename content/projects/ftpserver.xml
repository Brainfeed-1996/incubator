        <p>FtpServer was placed to the Incubator when procedure was not well defined. The

        <p>The origin of the FtpServer can be found in Avalon and primarily Paul Hammant
           as the initial contributor. As the codebase was developed in the scope of
           existing Apache projects, there are no Software Grants to be executed, nor
           any encumbered IP rights.</p>
