      <title>Description</title>
      <p>Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and 
      Apache Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.
      </p>

      <p>Although there are various excellent ORM frameworks for relational databases, data 
      modeling in NoSQL data stores differ profoundly from their relational cousins. Moreover, 
      data-model agnostic frameworks such as JDO are not sufficient for use cases, where one 
      needs to use the full power of the data models in column stores. Gora fills this gap by 
      giving the user an easy-to-use ORM framework with data store specific mappings and built 
      in Apache Hadoop support.
