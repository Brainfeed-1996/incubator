      <title>Description</title>
      <p>Thrift is cross-language serialization and RPC framework. It combines a powerful
         software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently
         and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, C#, Erlang, Perl, and
         several other languages. Thrift was originally developed at Facebook and
         open-sourced in April, 2007. Thrift entered the Apache Incubator in May, 2008.</p>
