                ACE - a software distribution framework based on OSGi that allows you to
                manage and distribute artifacts, like e.g. software components.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to centrally
              manage and distribute software components, configuration data and other
              artifacts to target systems. It is built using OSGi and can be deployed in
              different topologies. The target systems are usually also OSGi based, but
              don't have to be.
