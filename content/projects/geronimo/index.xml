      <p>Apache Geronimo is a new effort coordinated by the Apache Software
Foundation to make a J2EE compatible container. Please read the

        <a href="geronimo-proposal.html">proposal
</a>that started the project in the incubator. We are also tracking our

        <a href="../../projects/geronimo.html">status progressing through incubation
</a>.

      </p>
      <p>For more information, please read the latest snapshot of the

        <a href="#FAQ">FAQ
</a>below or look at the

        <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/">geronimo wiki
</a>.

      </p>
      <p>This is the official site for Geronimo while it's in the incubation
phase at Apache. We have an alpha version of our

        <li>Participate and contribute!
</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The most important step is to join the

        <a href="#Mailing+Lists">mailing list
</a>It is not necessary to post a "Hi" message or to join the project. By
subscribing to the list, you're joining the project. After that, it
is all down to participation.

      </p>
      <p>As with all

        <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache
</a>projects, the usual form is to get the project's source via CVS
tools, join the mailing list(s), find something to do, and submit a
patch to the mailing list for their approval and application.

      </p>
      <p>We assume that patch donators are familiar with CVS, diff and patch.
If you are not familiar with those tools, or want additional
information about how things work, here are some links:

      </ul>
      <p>Geronimo, if it passes the incubation stage, will become an

        <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache
</a>project. As an Apache project, the Apache approach to open source
community and development will apply. If you aren't familar with how
things are done by Apache projects, please familiarize yourself with
the information available on the

        <a href="http://www.apache.org">site
</a>. Here are some good selections from the Jakarta project site that
should help you understand the Apache community process :

      <p>Apache Geronimo has two mailing lists of interest, the geronimo-dev
list, where all the discussion occurs, and the geronimo-cvs list,
which receives commit mails each time a commit is made to the
incubator-geronimo

        <a href="#Where+is+the+source+and+download%3F">CVS
</a>module.

      </p>
      <p>You can subscribe to the mailing lists by sending an email to one or
both of the following addresses :
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="mailto:geronimo-dev-subscribe@incubator.apache.org">geronimo-dev-subscribe@incubator.apache.org

        <strong>However
</strong>, unless you subscribe to the list, you may not get a response.
Subscribing to the list is how you join the project, and follow
events.

      </p>
      <p>There is also a

        <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=140">mailing list archive

      <p>We have a number of code donations "on deck" which are being
evaluated. Once those donations are processed, then they will be
checked into the Apache Geronimo CVS module.
</p>
      <p>The CVS module is named

        <code>incubator-geronimo
</code>. Here is an example of checking out Apache Geronimo with the CVS
command-line client:

      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve">$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic $
cvs login Logging in to
:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:2401/home/cvspublic CVS password: $
cvs checkout incubator-geronimo ...
</source>
      <note>Use "anoncvs" for the anoncvs user's CVS password.
</note>
      <p>The code can be browsed through ViewCVS at

        <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/incubator-geronimo/">http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/incubator-geronimo/

      </note>
      <p>These are questions that have come up on the mailing list so far.
They are unofficial, but are best efforts by community members to
record useful answers.
</p>
      <p>Some questions are unanswered as yet. Have an answer? Please discuss
it on the mailing list, and record the conclusion here.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: I'd like to find out more and help etc. What do I do next?
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: Participation on the project is via the mailing list and the
source code repository. You join by joining the mailing list, and by
participating in discussion. You help by contributing your ideas,
enthusiasm, code, documentation, tests, and intangibles.
</p>
      <p>The fundamental tenet of the ASF is that Great Communities build
great code. The emphasis is on Community; the code comes from that.
If you want to help, just join the mailing list, see what needs to be
done, and do it.
</p>
      <p>Welcome. :-)
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Where is the mailing list? How do I subscribe?
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: The mailing list is geronimo-dev@incubator.apache.org. You
subscribe by sending e-mail to

        <a href="mailto:geronimo-dev-subscribe@incubator.apache.org">[geronimo-dev-subscribe@incubator.apache.org]
</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Is there an archive?
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A:

        <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=140">[Apache J2EE Archives]
</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Can you mail me if you're interested in me helping.
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: That's not how open source communities generally work. To the
people who have asked to be contacted if Apache are interested, it's
unlikely that this will happen with all the huge interest that this
has generated. Better to stay in touch with the mailing list.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Where is the Apache CVS module
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: incubator-geronimo

        <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/incubator-geronimo">[Browse CVS]
</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: The CVS module is empty, is there an issue
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: No. The initial committers have not publicly released the base
code. Be patient.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Will it involve JBoss code.
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: No.
</p>
      <p>This is a new Apache project, running under Apache guidelines. The
Apache Software Foundation accepts only voluntary contributions of
material from authors who possess the legal right to donate it.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Will it &lt;insert some technical phrase here&gt;?
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: It's probably worth holding these questions off for the moment.
This project is bringing together members and contributions from many
existing J2EE communities, and is just starting to come together.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: What are the rules for Geronimo?
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: See the

        <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">[Apache Incubator]
</a>web site.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: What's the website?
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A:

        <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/geronimo.html">[Apache J2EE Project]
</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: What tools do I need to learn?
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: CVS. patch. Using a mail list.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Relationship to JBoss and in particular, the JBoss source base.
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: Several (former) JBoss committers are Geronimo committers. The
JBoss codebase cannot, and will not, be used, at all (it is LGPL).
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Does Geronimo replace Tomcat, JSTL etc.
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: No. Geronimo includes other services like Tomcat or Jetty for the
web container, OpenJMS for the JMS, Tyrex for the transaction manager
etc. So Geroimo focusses on being the J2EE container allowing other
services to drop in via JMX.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: What other projects will Geronimo reuse?
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A: We suspect in the grand scheme of things to reuse various existing
open source projects. Anything which has a suitable BSD / ASF licence
is up for grabs. e.g. the following is a likely list of the things
well be using (though in no way is this definitive)...
</p>
      <p>From the ASF licenced projects...
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MX4J for JMX
</li>
        <li>Tomcat or Jetty for Web Container
</li>
        <li>Axis for Web Services Stack
</li>
        <li>James for email
</li>
        <li>OJB for JDO
</li>
        <li>commons-jndi for JNDI
</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As well as some non-ASF licenced stuff which is BSD licenced
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OpenJms for JMS
</li>
        <li>Tyrex for Transaction Manager
</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As well as the usual infrastructure...
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>commons-logging / log4j for logging
</li>
        <li>Xerces for XML parsing
</li>
        <li>maybe more of JakartaCommons as needed
</li>
        <li>Maven for building the distributions &amp; website
</li>
        <li>JUnit for unit testing
</li>
      </ul>
      <p>(1) There is currently a JNDI implementation in Tomcat's CVS. It
might be better to move this to Jakarta Commons so we can all work &amp;
extend it - there are various features from Jetty and OpenEjb we'd
like to add?
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Administration Overview such as an amalgamation of many projects
or one large project with subject areas.
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Timeline to 1.0 (what does it include).
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Will Geronimo be compliant with Sun's CTS.
</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: What is Geronimo's Architectural vision and what does the back
plane look like (i.e., is it JMX based?).
