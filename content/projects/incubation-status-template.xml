      <title>Project Incubation Status TEMPLATE</title>
      <p>This document is the template for project incubation status.</p>
      <p>What to do to set it up:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>copy this file and name it &lt;projectname&gt;.xml</li>
        <li>add a section in incubator/content/podlings.xml</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For this file:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>substitute the XYZ project name with the real one</li>
        <li>fill in the "Description". 
        See <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs.html#markdesc">Project Naming And Descriptions</a>
        </li>
        <li>edit "Project info" to contain only effective resources</li>
        <li>start doing "Incubation work items"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When an "Incubation work item" is done, place the date in the
         supplied space, and if necessary update "Project info" to reflect
         changes in resources.</p>
      <p>There are also sections where to place project news and incubation
         status reports.</p>
      <p>
        <em>On the first edit of this file, please delete this entire section.</em>
