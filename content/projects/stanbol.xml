          <p>Stanbol is a modular software stack and reusable set of components for semantic content management.</p>
          <p>Stanbol just entered incubation, on 2010-11-15.</p>
          <p>Mailing lists, SVN and JIRA are ready, most user accounts created, pre-existing code from the IKS project has been imported under a code grant.</p>
          <p>The Stanbol community has been invited to participate in a free workshop organized by the IKS project (*).
            It is a good opportunity to establish best practices for collaboration and communication between IKS
            (an EU-funded research project in which most current Stanbol committers are involved, http://iks-project.eu/) and the Stanbol podling.</p>
          <p>Branding requirements checked, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STANBOL-14</p>
          <p>Next steps:
          <ul>
            <li>leanup dependencies and code as per ASF requirements</li>
            <li>Make an initial release</li>
            <li>Start establishing and growing the community</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>Apache Stanbol is an open source modular software stack and reusable set of
            components for semantic content management. Incubating since November, 2010.</p>
          <p>Graduation:</p>
          <p>We believe Stanbol will be ready to graduate in the next few days: the
              issues mentioned in our previous report have been adressed, the release
              is being voted on (after six iterations of release candidates) and should
              be out in the next few days if all goes well. Community activity is steady
              and slowly increasing.</p>
          <p>Community:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No new committers or PPMC members since the last report, but steady activity
              on our lists from both existing and new members of our community.</li>
            <li>Two Stanbol committers have been elected as Clerezza committers, furthering
            ties between both podlings.</li>
            <li>A Stanbol GSoC project has been accepted, with Rupert Westenthaler as
            its mentor.</li>
            <li>Contribution of several EnhancementEngines based on LinguaGrid (NLP
            framework) by Alessio Bosca (STANBOL-583).</li>
            <li>Integration of DBpedia Spotlight (http://dbpedia.org/spotlight) with the
              Stanbol Enhancer, led by a new Stanbol contributor.</li>
            <li>Stanbol was presented in the Developer Track of WWW2012
              (slides: http://s.apache.org/AgK)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Project activity:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reorganization of the codebase for the release, the one binary dependency
                left that's not available in Maven Central has been moved to a separate
                -deps package for the release, as discussed on the incubator general list.</li>
            <li>Content hub faceted search improvements.</li>
            <li>New EnhancementEngine based on Apache Tika</li>
            <li>TopicEngine (STANBOL-197) is now functional</li>
            <li>Full LDpath support for the Entityhub Indexing tools (STANBOL-408).</li>
