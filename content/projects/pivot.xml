                Pivot - an open-source platform for building rich internet applications in Java.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pivot combines the enhanced productivity and usability features of a
              modern RIA toolkit with the robustness of the Java platform. Pivot
              applications are written using a combination of Java and XML and can
              be run either as an applet or as a standalone, optionally offline,
              desktop application.
