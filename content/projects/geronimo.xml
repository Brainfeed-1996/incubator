        <p>We have recieved a mail

          <a href="geronimo/20031031_jboss.pdf">a letter on behalf of the JBoss Group, LCC dated October 31, 2003
</a>that asks for clarifications regarding similarity between parts of
the Geronimo codebase and the JBoss codebase.

        </p>
        <p>We are thus in the process of actively reviewing not only the
specific claims but also the code base in general.

        <source>Status report for the Incubator Geronimo Project * is the STATUS file
up to date? (also post link) Yes
/home/cvs/incubator/site/projects/geronimo.cwiki * any legal,
cross-project or personal issues that still need to be addressed? A
serious legal issue was raised by JBoss Group LLC in a letter dated
10/31/2003. This issue has been thoroughly investigated and the
conclusion of the community is that the issues raised in the letter
are unfounded. A question has arisen whether it is permissible to
include XML Schema documents for J2EE deployment descriptors in CVS.
We have raised the issue with Sun and are awaiting a response. * what
has been done for incubation since the last report? The establishment
of a PPMC has aided the organization of the project. Added Gianny
D'Amour as committer. The community voted to keep the name "Geronimo"
The ASF has become a J2EE licensee, allowing us to start the
certification process. * plans and expectations for the next period?
To start testing with the J2EE TCK. To work with the Incubator PMC to
provide an interim release allowing people to use Geronimo without
building from source making it available to a larger community. To
address any remaining issues before applying to leave the Incubator.
* any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly for
you? The establishment of the PPMC has been a great help.
