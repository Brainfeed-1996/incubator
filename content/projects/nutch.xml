      <p>Nutch is web search software. It builds on the Apache Lucene search
library, adding a crawler, web database (including full link graph),
plugins for various document formats, user interface, etc. It is
currently used by sites such as

employer, that is capable of overriding their free will as
individuals, directly or indirectly.)

Doug) to work on Nutch.

incubation, since they required libraries with incompatible licenses.
Nearly all of these have since been re-written and re-enabled. Two
plugins remain disabled (parse-mp3 and parse-rtf) but these are not
critical. Through this process, all comitters have become familiar
with the legal issues related to Apache software.
