      <title>Description</title>
      <p>Ripple is going to be (in some circles already is) the goto
      emulator for rapid development of mobile web applications. This
      will be accomplished by quickly keeping up with the mobile web
      platforms as they arise (Cordova, Tizen, WAC, WebWorks,
      etc).</p>
