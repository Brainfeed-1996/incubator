      <title>Description</title>
      <p>Apache Airavata, a software framework to compose, manage, execute, and monitor 
         distributed applications and workflows on computational resources ranging from 
         local resources to computational grids and clouds. Airavata can be used as individual components or 
         as an integrated solution to build science gateways or general-purpose distributed 
         application and workflow management systems. Users can use Airavata back end services 
         and build gadgets to deploy in open social containers such as Apache Rave and modify them 
         to suit their needs. Airavata builds on general concepts of service oriented computing, 
         distributed messaging, and workflow composition and orchestration.</p>
