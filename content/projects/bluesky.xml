      <title>Description</title>
      <p>The Bluesky Project is an e-learning solution designed to help solve the disparity in availabilty of education 
      	between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China. 
      	It had been deployed to 12 + 5 primary/high schools with positive reviews. We enter the incubation to revolve our system so that 
      	poor regions around the world could share higher education resources.</p>
