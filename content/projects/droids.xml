          Droids aims to be an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows to create
          and extend existing droids (robots). Droids entered incubation on October 24nd, 2008.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Droids project has just started. The basic infrastructure
          (mailing lists, subversion, issue tracker, web site) still is not
          in place. We expect to get started with the actual design and code work
          during the next few weeks.
