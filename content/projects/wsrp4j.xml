        <li>2006-05-30 New committer: Vishal Goenka</li>
        <li>We developed Google Summer of Code proposal for a chunk of new

        <li>We voted to move to Subversion and Maven.
</li>
        <li>We have received contributions from outside developers, which we hope
grows into more diverse participation.
</li>
        <li>I (jmacna@apache.org) have met with constituents from higher
education that are using WSRP4J and see a strong role for WSRP in
their software plans, and I have encouraged them to contribute to the
project publicly. We have seen increased participation from these
teams already.
