      <p>
        Graffito (formerly JCMS) is dedicated to build a complete CMS
        solution on top of existing content management frameworks
        (like Slide or Jackrabbit). One of the design goals of Graffito
        is to be easily integrated in a JSR-168 portal environment like
        Pluto or Jetspeed 2.

          Graffito is a framework for content-based applications,
          especially in portlet environments. Graffito entered incubation
          on September 20, 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite recent efforts the level of activity within the Graffito
          project remains low. The only part of the project that enjoys
          continued interest and commit activity is the JCR Mapping
          component, whose transfer into a subproject of Apache Jackrabbit
          is being prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is little indication that the level of activity within other
          parts of the Graffito project would increase in future, so we will
          most likely request termination of the project as retired as soon
          as the JCR Mapping component has been moved to Apache Jackrabbit.

          Graffito is a framework for content-based applications,
          especially in portlet environments. Graffito entered incubation

        <p>
          The recent discussion on the status of the Graffito project has
          concluded with some concrete action items (see
          <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-graffito-dev/200702.mbox/%3c3b728ee90702140445i5d21bd22j95fb5b67c58abc70@mail.gmail.com%3e">the thread</a>).
          The plan is to realign Graffito to be more a content management
          framework instead of a complete CMS product and to better leverage
          the features of JCR content repositories.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect of these plans on commit activity remains to be seen,
          but as of now the general feeling around the project is positive.
          Hopefully we'll have some concrete results to show by the time of
          the next report.

        <p>Top three items to resolve before graduation:</p>

          <li>Build a self-sustaining community</li>
          <li>Create an incubating Graffito release</li>
          <li>Move the JCR mapping component to the Jackrabbit project</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There hasn't been much activity in the Graffito project since
          the last report. A discussion on what to do with the project that
          still hasn't reached "critical mass" after over two years of
          incubation is currently taking place. The perceived complexity of
          the project is seen by many as a barrier to start using or
          contributing to Graffito. Splitting the project into more
          manageable component projects was raised as one potential
          approach to reviving the codebase and project community.

        <p>
          Graffito activity has increased noticeably since the last report,
          especially due to interest from within the Jackrabbit community.

          <li>
            Given positive feedback from both communities, we are evaluating
            options for moving the JCR mapping component from Graffito into
            the Jackrabbit project. This would expose the component to a
            wider JCR developer community and a larger audience of potential
            users.
          </li>
          <li>
            There has been renewed discussion on producing incubating

            Edgar Poce has been working on a related JCR-based wysiwyg
            portlet prototype, using the Graffito mailing list for design
            discussions, but the implementation approach differs from the
            Graffito portlet model, so at least for now the tool is not
            being integrated into Graffito

          There was not so much commits on the project due to the current
          commiters activities. The company Sword Technologies donates new
          Graffito services (worfklow, news management , mail and scheduler
          services). Christophe will try to review and commit this code asap.

        <p>
          The Spring support is finished for the OCM Tools. Now the OCM tools
          will be used in the complete Graffito stack. By this way, the
          Graffito persistence service can access to JCR repositories.

        <pre>1) Is the STATUS file up to date? Yes 2) Any legal, cross-project or
personal issues that still need to be addressed? no 3) What has been
done for incubation since the last report? * The most important work
was made on the Jetspeed 2 integration &amp; building some JSR-168
portlets. There is a content tree view, a document viewer and an
admin browser portlet. Futhermore, we have integrate an HTML editor
(Kupu). * Some work has been done for the security management (fine
grain access control, permission management, JAAS support, ...). * We
have started raising awareness and promoting the project on some
other Apache and non-Apache lists in order build further the
community. * New developers have started collaborating with the core
team on Graffito work, especially JCR mapping tools. 4) Plans and
expectations for the next period? * Implementing our JCR mapping
framework with Jackrabbit. * XML editor integration. * A Graffito
implementation for the Jetspeed 2 page manager. * Continue our work
on the JSR-168 portlets (search &amp; version management). * Start a site
demo with a Jetspeed integration * We expect the committer base to
expand during next period given the current developer participation
on the dev mailing-lists. 5) Any recommendations for how incubation
could run more smoothly for you? None so far.

avoid naming confusion with Jalios JCMS, another Java based CMS
system. 3) What has been done for incubation since the last report? *
We cleaned up repository, site, build process, site deployment and
publishing to help new users and developers jump into the project. *
Christophe Lombart account has been created and karma granted * ASF
Infrastructure has been set up for Graffito * We are working on the
Jetspeed 2 integration &amp; building JSR 168 portlets. 4) Plans and
expectations for the next period? * Add more info in the Graffito
site * WEBDAV integration * More work on Jetspeed 2 integration,
building portlets. * Introduce Graffito to some important to related
projects: Slide, JackRabbit, Jetspeed ... in order to grow the
development community 5) Any recommendations for how incubation could
run more smoothly for you? None so far. All is well.
