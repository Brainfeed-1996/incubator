      <title>Description
</title>
      <p>Solr is a search server focused on full-text search, relevancy, and
performance. It builds on the Apache Lucene search library, adding
features such as
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Query and update interfaces over HTTP and XML or JSON.</li>
        <li>Hit Highlighting</li>
        <li>Faceted Search</li>
        <li>Replication based on index snapshots and rsync.
</li>
        <li>A schema allowing declarative specification of fields and their
types, including specification of text analysis filter chains.
</li>
        <li>External configuration for Lucene parameters, stopword lists, and
synonym lists.
</li>
        <li>A web based admin interface with statistics and debugging.
</li>
        <li>An extensive caching framework for filters, queries, documents, and
user caches.
</li>
        <li>Plugins for customizing query handling, caching and many other server
aspects.
</li>
      </ul>
