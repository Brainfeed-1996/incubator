                Ode is an orchestration service that implements the WS-BPEL specification. The
                project includes an orchestration engine abstraction, standard externally
                defined interfaces/bindings. The interface implementations and/or bindings
                enables the orchestration service to be plugged into various service bus or
                component architectures.
