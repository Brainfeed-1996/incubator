                 <em>After the name 'Felix' was proposed for the project, and before we 
                     actually voted on it, a search on the US PTO for "Felix" was done.
                     That search produced about 50 hits of live trademarks. As far as 
                     could be determined, only one was definitely related to computers 
                     (clusters). Further research from showed that the 
                     owning company (MPI software technology) was acquired by another 
                     company and no references on the new combined website could be 
                     found regarding "Felix". References (message ID's on the oscar-dev mailing list):
