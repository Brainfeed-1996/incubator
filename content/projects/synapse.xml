      <title>Description
</title>
      <p>The Synapse project is creating a robust, lightweight and highly scalable XML and Web Service mediation framework
based on open standards and specifications.
</p>
      <p>To participate in the Synapse podling, you should join the mailing
list. Just send an empty message to

        <em>synapse-dev-subscribe@ws.apache.org
</em>.

      </p>
      <p>The initial goal of the project while in incubation is to build a
viable developer community and create a useful codebase. In particular, it is a stated aim of this project to re-use and integrate with other components
from the Apache Web Services project such as Axis2, Axiom, Sandesha, Rampart, etc.

subproject will follow the Apache WS PMC's direction. All committers on this subproject will be committers on Apache WS and vice-versa.
