      <title>Description</title>
      <p>Curator is a set of Java libraries that make using Apache ZooKeeper much easier.
While ZooKeeper comes bundled with a Java client, using the client is
non-trivial and error prone. It consists of three components that build on each
other. Curator Client is a replacement for the bundled ZooKeeper class that
takes care of some low-level housekeeping and provides some useful utilities.
Curator Framework is a high-level API that greatly simplifies using ZooKeeper.
It adds many features that build on ZooKeeper and handles the complexity of
managing connections to the ZooKeeper cluster and retrying operations. Curator
Recipes consists of implementations of some of the common ZooKeeper "recipes".
Additionally, Curator Test is included which includes utilities to help with
unit testing ZooKeeper-based applications.</p>
