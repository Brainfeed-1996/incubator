      <title>Description
</title>
      <p>The Beehive project is an extensible Java application framework with
an integrated metadata-driven programming model for web services, web
applications, and resource access. The framework leverages the latest
innovations in the forthcoming JDK 1.5, particularly JSR 175 metadata
annotations. It currently builds on key Apache projects such as
Tomcat, Struts, MyFaces, and Axis.
</p>
      <p>While this proposal focuses on a framework consisting of these three
subprojects, it is expected that the Apache community will come up
with additional innovative ideas that will evolve into future
subprojects. The currently planned components include:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Controls: The Control architecture is a lightweight component
framework based upon annotated JavaBeans, exposing a simple and
consistent client model for accessing a variety of J2EE resource
types. The framework provides a variety of functions including:
JavaBean-based client access, configuration through JSR-175 metadata
and external configuration data, automatic resource management,
context services, and an extensible authoring model for creating new
Control types.
</li>
        <li>NetUI: NetUI Page Flow is a web application framework based on Apache
Struts with an easy to use, single-file programming model based on
JSR-175 metadata. It builds on the core Struts separation of
model/view/controller elements, and adds features such as automatic
state management and first-class integration with Controls, XMLBeans,
and Java Server Faces.
</li>
        <li>Metadata for Java Web Services: This component is an implementation
of the JSR-181 specification and is a key piece of the Beehive
framework. JSR 181 uses JSR-175 metadata annotations in Java methods
and classes to easily build Web services.

        <strong>2005-04-26
</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>Beehive is in the home stretch of its 1.0-level release; we declared
a beta release in March, and are on track to deliver a 1.0 in the
late May timeframe. Posting automated daily builds continues to be an
challenge, but otherwise infrastructure is well in place. At this
point we are largely focused on fit'n'finish issues in the code, as
well as a polished set of samples and documentation.

        <br/>
        <br/>The Beehive community added Bryan Che as a new committer in February,
2005. With the beta release and open planning on features for the
next version, we are seeing increased dev/user list activity -- we
anticipate that the 1.0 release will be even more significant in
building the community, and hope to graduate from the Incubator
sometime soon after the 1.0 release. Certain Beehive components have
a very clear affinity with the Apache Struts and AXIS projects, and
those projects may play a role in graduation (pending further
discussion).

        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>2004-10-18
</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Code &amp; Infrastructure
</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>initial code drop was made in mid-July. Ongoing development is very
active.
</li>
        <li>over the last three months, we've set up SVN, JIRA, a website, and a
wiki.
</li>
        <li>docs and tutorials contributions continue - a better Beehive build
system has been proposed by a contributor. It is currently under
review by committers.
</li>
        <li>Beehive jars were added to java-repository in order to support
control builders who prefer to use Maven.
</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Legal
</strong>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>all code shows ASF copyright notice.
</li>
        <li>software grant, individual CLAs, and corporate CLAs, are in place for
all active committers (one initial committer has no account while we
wait for his employer to complete review of CLA and CCLA)
</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Community
</strong>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Web services metadata subproject has participation from key members
of Axis community; We've accepted Wolfgang (Fumitada Hattori) as a
new committer on the project in the Web services area
</li>
        <li>NetUI and Controls subprojects are still primarily driven by BEA
employees. We expect this to begin to change after getting out an
initial release for the community to experiment with and digest.
</li>
        <li>We've seen a growth in interest/use on both the user and dev mailing
lists
</li>
        <li>Amazon, XFire and Hibernate pre-1.0 controls built on Beehive have
been released at Controlhaus.
</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Release Plans
</strong>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>The community cut a pre-1.0 release for ApacheCon. This release
followed the incubation release rules requiring a) incubator
disclaimer in README and from any download links, b) filename to
include 'incubating', and c) ppmc vote (providing the incubator pmc
approval since all interested incubator pmc members should be on the
beehive ppmc mailing list.
</li>
        <li>A generic release plan proposed and discussed but needs a final vote.
Roadmap documents have been posted to make it easier for new
developers to get the big picture and figure out where they can help.
</li>
      </ul>
