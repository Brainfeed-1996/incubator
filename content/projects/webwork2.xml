      <title>Description
</title>
      <p>The Apache Struts project and the members of the OpenSymphony WebWork
      2 project are working together on a next-generation web application 
      framework utilizing an action/request architecture. WebWork was initially
      created by Rickard Oberg to improve on the ideas and functionality of the
      Jakarta Struts framework. (Now known as the Apache Struts Action
      framework.) Since then, the WebWork community has continued to extend and
      refine the framework's capabilities through a long series of releases,
      the latest of which, 2.2, brings advanced Ajax, templating, and Java 5
      capabilities to its solid WebWork 2 foundation. While, to date, the
      WebWork and Struts Action codebases have overlapped, recent movements to
      bring consolidation to the web framework landscape have inspired both
      communities to work together. Apache Struts has recently reorganized our
      codebase into multiple subprojects, two of which, Shale and Action,
      represent two separate but equal web frameworks. Struts Shale serves the
      nascent JSF community, while Struts Action serves the established JSP
      community. The WebWork 2 code will be brought into the Action subproject
      as the 2.x branch.
