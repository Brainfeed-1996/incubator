      <title>Purpose of this document
</title>
      <p>Apache has a particular way of dealing with projects which is usually
summed up as

        <strong>the Apache Way
</strong>.

        <br/>The purpose of this document is to aggergate and integrate all
information about how Apache operates both technically and socially.
It's a live document, and as such it tries to reflect the current
situation at Apache, but keep in mind that reality is much more
dynamic and changes continuously, so it will be probable that there
are some inconsistencies with what you will see.

        <br/>Apache is also about helping each other, so if you find errors or
omissions, please tell us at our mailing list, where we will be more
than happy to hear from you.
