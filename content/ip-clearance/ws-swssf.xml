      <p>
      In order to be able to use WS-Security, typically the DOM processing model will be applied. 
      For further processing, the XML document must be fully read into an object-tree by 
      the DOM parser. The whole object-tree is hold in the computer memory during the processing. This requires 
      a lot of processor and memory resources. Now, if an attacker sends over-sized SOAP documents, it can lead
      to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. For encrypted documents the memory consumption is even higher. 
      Firstly, the entire SOAP Message must be read into memory, then the decryption can be performed. 
      The decrypted XML part must be read in an object-tree again. At this time, both the encrypted and decrypted 
      XML part is present in the memory. Afterwards the encrypted XML part can be replaced with the decrypted one.
      </p>
      <p>
      WS-Security provides integrity, authenticity and confidentiality at the message level. But which parts of 
      the SOAP message must be secured and how is not defined in the WS-Security standard. What are the 
      requirements for a SOAP client to access a Web Service successfully? Must the entire SOAP body to be encrypted? 
      Is a timestamp expected? Must the message be signed? Which keys must be used and in which format are they 
      expected? In order to express such requirements, the WS-SecurityPolicy standard was introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
      If WS-SecurityPolicy is applied in an DOM environment and the client sends a message which does not 
      correspond to the policy, a lot of computer resources are unnecessarily wasted again. The DOM parser fully 
      reads the message into memory, the WS-Security framework processes the document using the security header 
      and as last the WS-SecurityPolicy framework notes that the document was not protected as the policy it demanded.
      </p>
      <p>
      This work presents a streaming-based WebService-Security-Framework with the ability to process large SOAP 
      documents efficiently. The streaming-based processing of the messages is done via the StAX-API. With the 
      streaming-oriented approach it is possible to gradually read and process the messages without keeping the 
      entire message in the memory. If it is not possible to process the message, for example because the used keys 
      are not known, the process can be aborted immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
      The integration of WS-SecurityPolicy makes it possible to achieve the wished "fail-fast" behavior. This is, 
      because policy relevant events can and will be evaluated immediately.

      Me, Marc Giger &lt;gigerstyle@gmx.ch&gt; contributes/donates my Streaming-WebService-Security-Framework (swssf) to
      the WSS4J project. A part of this work (encryption, decryption and policy-verification) was developed for 
      my master-thesis in Applied IT Security. The swssf codebase consists of about 26396 lines java code and
      additionally about 9263 lines of test code (526 Tests).
      </p>
      <p>
      The contributed code is attached to issue WSS-311
