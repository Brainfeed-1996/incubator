      <title>Description</title>
        <p>XKMS will be contributed as a service (like STS and WS-Discovery) providing standardized access to central public key infrastructure (PKI) including lookup, validation, registration, reissuing and revocation of public keys.  XKMS will help users to manage their certificates centrally instead storing them into local keystores, that are best practice for middle/large service landscapes.</p>
