      <title>Description</title>
      <p>
	PaDaF provides tools to make a PDF/A preflight on a PDF document. It is highly based on Apache PDFBox. 
	Conformance to the ISO 19005 (PDF/A) norm is checked.
      </p>
      <p>
	The contributed code is attached to issue
        <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-1056">PDFBOX-1056</a>
        with the following description:
      </p>
      <p>
	<em>We (Atos Worldline) donate our PDF/A validator to the PDFBox project. 
	This product is based on PDFBox and a javacc parser. Before this donation, 
	the product was already distributed under Apache Licence 2. Its current name 
	is padaf. 
	Padaf complies the isartor test suite. 
	This version depends on standard PDFBox 1.5.0 version. Only one test class 
	does not compile with current HEAD (on 27 of june), all other test cases pass. 

	Padaf is composed of 2 modules : 
	<ul>
		<li>preflight : the validator</li>
		<li>
		xmpbox : an other implementation of xmp parser and writer. We make 
		that choice because we did not have the time to propose all necessary 
		modification in jempbox.
		</li> 
	</ul>
	The attached tar ball contains : 
	<ul>
		<li>sources of the 2 modules</li>
		<li>junit tests for each one</li>
		<li>a parent (that will soon disappear) already depending on pdfbox-parent</li> 
	</ul>
