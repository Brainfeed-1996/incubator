      <title>Description</title>
      <p>
      The incubating Apache Sling project has a module in the form of a single
      OSGi bundle which provides a Web Based Management Console. The bundle
      allows mainly for OSGi management such as bundle lifecycle management,
      configuration, etc. But the console is in fact extensible and more
      functionality may easily be plugged into it. Because this module is
      in fact a bundle which may be of use for any OSGi framework management
      it may be of interest to other projects employing OSGi as well. For this
      reason the Apache Felix and Sling communities agreed to move the Web Based
      Management Console from Apache Sling to Apache Felix.
