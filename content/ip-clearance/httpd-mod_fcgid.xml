      <p>
         Apache HTTP Server's mod_fcgid is a module for httpd that
         enables the server framework to provide FastCGI services
         using a clean-room implementation of the FastCGI 1.0 specification
         (<a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fcgi-spec.html">http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fcgi-spec.html</a>).
