      <p>The Improved HttpService contribution is flexible implementation of the
OSGi HttpService implementation with extended features : Extended API to support
servlet filters;Backward compatible with standard HttpService (without Filter support);
A bridged implementation (for use inside a Servlet Container); A jetty
implementation (embedding the Jetty Servlet Container); Separate dispatcher so
that we can have different "transports". This contribution is composed of
multiple Maven projects.</p>
