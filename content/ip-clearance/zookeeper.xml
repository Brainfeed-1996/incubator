        <title>Preamble</title>
      <p>This is code for the zookeeper tool that was developed by Yahoo, which
will be used and maintained with Hadoop to provide distributed coordination 
between servers. The tool was previously licensed under the Apache License 
2.0 and has now been granted to the ASF.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
IP Clearance processing must be executed either by an Officer 
or a Member of the ASF. <em>If you are not an Officer or a Member,
please contact your project chair who will find an appropriate 
volunteer.</em> Incubator karma is also required. Please request
karma from the incubator pmc if you do not have it.
            </li>
            <li>
(Optional) <em>Commit an outline <a href='#form-filling'>form</a>, 
filling those parts which can be (at this stage)</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
A software grant must be provided to the ASF. This grant can either be
done by the ASF Corporate CLA (via Schedule B) or the traditional
License Agreement. Acceptable methods of sending the grant to the
ASF includes:
<ul>
<li>snail-mail to the ASF office and/or ASF officer</li>
<li>FAXing to the ASF office and/or an ASF officer</li>
<li>Emailing the scanned document to secretary@apache.org
   <em>and</em> legal-archive@apache.org.</li>
 </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
Receipt of the software grant form <strong>must</strong> be acknowledged
by an Officer of the ASF by recording in the correct file (<em>grants.txt</em> for a License Grant
or <em>cclas.txt</em> for a Corporate CLA). In most normal circumstances,
the officer should be the ASF Secretary, who must be provided a copy of
the grant or CCLA in any case (if not originally sent or Emailed
to him).
            </li>
            <li>
<strong>Note:</strong> the grant form <strong>must</strong> be acknowledged
before continuing. If the source is referenced by checksum in the grant, 
commit the canonical tarball for the donated code into the incubator
drop area together with a checksum and a detached signature. This will
ensure that apache has a legal record of the grant.
            </li>
            <li>
Complete and commit the <a href='#form-filling'>completed form</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
Post a message to general@incubator prefixed [IP CLEARANCE] asking for
clearance to be checked. Sign off is by lazy consensus so wait at least
72 hours for a -1. 
            </li>
            <li>
Post a [RESULT] to close the thread and let the project know that the 
code has been cleared for import.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <title>Filling The Form</title>
      <p>This file should not last long in place before it is moved to the
successful incubation area. The sole purpose is to ensure that IP is
cleared so that the codebase can be merged into the ASF SVN.</p>
      <p>For this file:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>substitute the XYZ name with the real one</li>
        <li>fill in the description</li>
        <li>fill in the work items</li>
        <li>remove this notice</li>
        <li>set a proper "title" element for the html page</li>
