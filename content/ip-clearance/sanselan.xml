      <p>
        Sanselan is a pure-java image library for reading and writing a variety of image formats. The initial work on Sanselan was
        begun in 2004 by Charles M. Chen, and was open sourced soon after. Much of the code was finished by the end of 2004, and work
        since then has been primarily been bug fixes, simplification of the API, and addition of optional parameters to allow finer-grained control.
