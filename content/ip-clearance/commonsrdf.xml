      <p>
        Commons RDF is a library which provides a set of interfaces for the RDF 
        1.1 concepts that can be used to expose common RDF 1.1 concepts using 
        common Java interfaces. The goal is to provide agreed and clear 
        interfaces that could be implemented by the upcoming versions of the 
        main Java toolkits (Apache Jena 3.0 and OpenRDF Sesame 4.0) as well as 
        reused by existing wrappers.
