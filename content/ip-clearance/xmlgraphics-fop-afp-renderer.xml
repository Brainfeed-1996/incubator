      <title>Description</title>
      <p>
        The AFP Renderer is an additional output backend (like PDF and PostScript) for Apache FOP. AFP is
        a printer language from IBM mostly used in high-volume printing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AFP Renderer for FOP version 0.20.5 was developed by Pete Townsend with support from
        Joe Schmetzer. The project is currently hosted on SourceForge 
        (<a href="http://afp-renderer.sourceforge.net/">http://afp-renderer.sourceforge.net/</a>).
        Both developers have indicated their willingness to donate the code to the ASF.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code has already been extensively reviewed and adapted to the latest FOP release by
        Manuel Mall an active FOP committer.
