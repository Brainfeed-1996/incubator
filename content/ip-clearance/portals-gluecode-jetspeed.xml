      <p>The incoming code was contributed by Gluecode Software. It is
contributing to the Jetspeed codebase as a patch. The patch is
installed in the jakarta-jetspeed CVS, under the directory 'fusion'.
Fusion is an optional feature for Jetspeed-1. It provides support for
'JSR-168' Portlets in Jetspeed-1. This feature allows for portlets to
be deployed in a standard Portlet Application to Jetspeed-1, and run
inside a Java Portlet API-compliant portlet container. Fusion
leverages Jetspeed-2 components and pipelines embedded in the
Jetspeed-1 server. Fusion was written by a Jetspeed contributor for
hire, David S Taylor.
