      <title>Description</title>
      <p>This is code from the plexus-webdav component at Codehaus which is used within Archiva that will now be maintained (and restructured)
        within the project specific to its own purposes.</p>
      <p>The library includes a fork of the it.could webdav library (http://could.it/main/a-simple-approach-to-webdav.html). The code is
        licensed under the Apache License 2.0. It is also written by an Apache CLA holder, Pier Fumagalli, however he is not involved in this
        fork.</p>
