      <p>
        The contribution is a set of "bundle persistence manager" components
        for Apache Jackrabbit. The contribition will be included as new Java
        classes and packages in the existing jackrabbit-core component.
        The contribution also contains minor changes to existing Jackrabbit
        classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contributed code is attached to issue
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-755">JCR-755</a>
        with the following description:

      <p>
        <em>we (day software) offer our set of bundle persistence managers
        to the jackrabbit project. those pms combine the node and property
        states into a single bundle and store them together. this improves
        performance and reduces storage-memory overhead (no exact numbers
        available). The bundle pms also have a "bundle-cache" that does a
        memory sensitive caching of the bundles and a negative cache for
        non-existent bundles. small binary properties are inlined into the
        bundle rather than stored in the blobstore.</em>
