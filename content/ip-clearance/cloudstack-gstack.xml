      <title>Description</title>
      <p> gstack is an API wrapper that maps the Google Cloud Platform compute engine (GCE) API to the CloudStack API.
It consist in a Python Flask application that implements a web server that serves a GCE compatible API. The API calls are mapped to the
CloudStack API. It serves as an API proxy and translater to allow users of Google GCE to use the GCE client to issue API calls to a CloudStack public or private cloud.
The code contains the server and API routes, as well as unit tests.
