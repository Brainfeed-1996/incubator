      <title>Description</title>
        <p>This donation is to add a WS-Eventing service to Apache CXF.   This service implements the WS-Eventing specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-eventing/ and was done as part of Jan Martiska's masters thesis.
        
            WS-Eventing, as the name suggests, introduces a mechanism how to notify clients about events, that have occurred somewhere. You can for example publish a service, which watches product prices and notifies subscribed clients when there is an interesting sale, or the price of a product simply goes under a chosen value.
