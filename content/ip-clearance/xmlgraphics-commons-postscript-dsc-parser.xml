      <p>
        The patch adds a DSC parser/processor to XML Graphics Commons. Commons already contains
        code to generate PostScript files. The DSC specification describes special comments
        in PostScript code which are used to structure a PostScript document. More detailed
        info can be found in the BugZilla issue.
