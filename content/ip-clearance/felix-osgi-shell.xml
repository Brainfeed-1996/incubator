      <title>Description</title>
      <p>Early drafts of the R4.2 spec include a specification for a new OSGi Shell (RFC-132).
      The idea is that this will be a shell that is shared by all OSGi implementations. 
      An initial implementation of the spec was written by Peter Kriens and donated to the
      Apache Felix project.</p>
