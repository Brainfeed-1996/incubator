      <title>Description</title>
      <p>Jackrabbit FileVault introduces a JCR repository to filesystem mapping. The mapping is 
         exposed by an API and used by the CRX "Content Packaging" that allows to 
         create portable packages of repository content. The Vault Command Line 
         Interface aka "vlt" provides a subversion like utility to work and develop 
         with repository content.
      </p>
      <p>This is a rather large contribution of code that was developped over 5 years
         and consists of 450 Java classes and interfaces.
