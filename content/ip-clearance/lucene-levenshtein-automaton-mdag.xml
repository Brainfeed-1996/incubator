      <p>
        Kevin Lawson is contributing source code he developed to the Lucene Core project.  See
        <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-4947">LUCENE-4947</a> for more
        details.
      </p>
      <p>
        LevenshteinAutomaton is a fast and comprehensive Java library capable of performing
        automaton and non-automaton based Levenshtein distance determination and neighbor
        calculations. The collection of related utilities affords developers the luxury of
        choosing the most appropriate edit distance-related procedure for their needs at any
        given time.
      </p>
      <p>
        MDAG (minimalistic directed acyclic graph) is used by the automaton code to store and
        step through word sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The LevenshteinAutomaton and MDAG sources are currently hosted on Github at
        <a href="https://github.com/klawson88/LevenshteinAutomaton"
        >https://github.com/klawson88/LevenshteinAutomaton</a>, and
