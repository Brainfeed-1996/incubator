      <title>Description</title>
      <p>
        This code base contains three modules which aim to replace the excitsing modules
        generator, templates and maven2-plugin in the DB Torque project.
        The specialized Torque code generator is replaced by a general-purpose code generator.
        To accomodate this, the code generation templates have to be changed as well;
        the changed templates are contained in the code base. Finally, a new Torque Maven2 Plugin
        will integrate the generator into Maven2. The new plugin is also contained in the codebase.
        The code base was contributed by Thomas Fischer, who is member of the DB PMC.
