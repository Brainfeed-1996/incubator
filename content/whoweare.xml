      <p>We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for
support. We are non-paid volunteers who help out with the project and
we do not necessarily have the time or energy to help people on an
individual basis. Instead, we have setup mailing lists which often
contain hundreds of individuals who will help answer detailed
requests for help. The benefit of using mailing lists over private
communication is that it is a shared resource where others can also
learn from common mistakes and as a community we all grow together.

        <title>The Incubator Project Management Commitee (PMC)</title>
		<p>
The Incubator PMC is responsible to the <a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/'>Board</a>
for the management of the Incubator Project. Only votes cast by members of the incubator PMC
are binding upon Apache. The work that this project is charged with overseeing differs from 
other projects and so functions a little differently. 
For more details read the <a href="&root-path;/guides/pmc.html">Incubator PMC guide</a>.
