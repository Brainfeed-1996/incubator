        <p>
The <a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/'>Board Of Directors</a> of the 
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/'>Apache Software Foundation</a> manages
the organizational affairs of the Foundation.
The board is elected by the 
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html'>Apache Members</a>. 
      </p>
        <p>
The Board delegates responsibility for incubation to the 
<a href='#Incubator+Project+Management+Committee+%28PMC%29'>IPMC</a>. 
      </p>
        <p>
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/'>Directors</a> are often active in the
Incubator.
<a href='http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#hats'>Conventionally</a>,
unless indicated otherwise, individuals speak personally. So, a Director speaking
without their Board hat is not stating policy but expressing a personal opinion.

</title>
<p>The Incubator PMC
[<a href="&root-path;/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html#Incubator+Project+Management+Committee+%28PMC%29">definition</a>]
is responsible for: 
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>acceptance and oversight of candidate projects submitted or proposed
to become part of the Foundation;
</li>
          <li>providing guidance and ensuring that sub-projects under it's purview
develop products according to the Foundation's philosophy and
guidelines for collaborative development;
</li>
          <li>providing a repository for the storage of incubation history and
information;
</li>
          <li>assisting a Podling's Mentor in discharging her/his duties;
</li>
          <li>regularly evaluating projects under its purview for the purposes of
recommending to the Sponsor whether the project should:
</li>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            <ul>
              <li>graduate from incubation;
</li>
              <li>continue to receive guidance and support within the Incubator; or
</li>
              <li>be terminated.
</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To enable effective management of the process of incubation from the
point of view of the PMC and from the point of view of members of a
project under incubation, a set of policies and procedures are
described below that identify roles and responsibilities of
participants throughout the incubation lifecycle.
</p>
        <p>A project going through the Incubator will therefore be required to
regularly report to the Incubator PMC. This will help the PMC in its
role of reviewing the status of a project under incubation.
</p>
        <p>Finally, the Incubator PMC is the ASF body with the greatest level of
expertise and experience in the Incubation process. They provide a
store of knowledge that can be called on by the Mentor or a Podling
during (or even after) the incubation process. In cases where an
Incubation is particularly large, or where the Incubator PMC
otherwise feels the Mentor needs additional assistance, the Incubator
PMC may choose to provide an experienced Mentor to assist the main
Mentor in discharging their duty.
</p>
        <p>Individuals may be nominated to join the IPMC after a vote which
passes with more than 3/4 of those voting.  Additionally, any Member of the
Apache Software Foundation may join the IPMC by request.

      <section id="Candidate">
        <title>Candidate
</title>
        <p>A Candidate [<a href='Incubation_Policy.html#Candidate'>definition</a>] 
is a project proposed for incubation. A Candidate 
shall meet the following minimum criteria:
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>affiliated with a named *Champion* (an ASF Member or Officer; see
below)
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Optionally, a candidate may:
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>declare an affiliation with an existing Apache Project in which case
the project will become the *Sponsor*;
</li>
          <li>specify requirements that may be anticipated during incubation; and/or
</li>
          <li>provide a summary of the project relationship/dependencies (existing
or planned with existing Apache Projects/Products).
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Naturally, projects will need more than this in order to graduate from
incubation status.
</p>
        <p>A candidate project compliant with the above criteria may be proposed
by the Champion to the Sponsor for acceptance as a Podling.
Acceptance of a candidate shall be subject to the formal voting
method of the Sponsor. Should that vote be accepted, the Sponsor will
request that the Incubator PMC accept the candidate as a Podling
under incubation. The Sponsor shall assign a Mentor, who shall be
granted membership of the Incubator PMC for the duration of the
incubation process.
</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Champion">
        <title>Champion</title>
        <p>
            A candidate project shall be sponsored by an 
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/index.html">Officer</a> or
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html">Member</a>
            of the Foundation. The Champion assists the candidate on their
            initial submission to a Sponsor. While private conversations are not
            generally encouraged within the Apache community, the Champion's
            relationship with the Candidate should allow for this in order to
            educate the Candidate about the Apache Way and prepare the project
            for the questions and issues likely to be raised by the community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before incubation begins, the Champion is expected to:
            <ul>
               <li>help with any process/ASF related hurdles before the Candidate enters incubation</li>
               <li>help find the right people in the ASF to speak with</li>
               <li>help to find Mentors</li>
               <li>drive the process of entering the Incubator, leading to a vote to accept the proposed podling</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Sponsor">
        <title>Sponsor</title>
        <p>
            The Sponsor [<a href="&root-path;/incubation/Incubator_Policy.html#Sponsor">definition</a>]
            is the entity within the ASF that makes the determination 
            that a candidate would make a worthy addition to the ASF, and agrees
            to take on the candidate in question (or in the case of the Incubator
            PMC, assist it in finding a home) should it complete the incubation
            process.
        </p>
        <p>A Sponsor will be one of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
              A Top Level Project within the ASF. In this case, the project in
              question has agreed that the candidate is a good fit for their
              project, and will take on the candidate as a sub-project upon
              successful completion of Incubation.
          </li>
          <li>
              The Incubator PMC. In this case, the Incubator PMC agrees that the
              project in question will make a good addition to the ASF, but there
              is no clear "owner" of the candidate should it successfully complete
              incubation. An incubation exit requirement for such candidates will
              be the identification (and successfuly lobbying) of an "owner" entity
              - either the <a href='#board'>Board</a> (and the candidate will be a TLP) or another
              project. In most cases, the Incubator PMC is the correct Sponsor (Candidates should discuss this
              with their Champion).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note that a Sponsor is more than just a final resting place for a
            candidate that successfully completes incubation. The Sponsor, by
            taking on a candidate, is indicating that they believe the candidate
            will make a worthy addition to the ASF, and takes responsibility for
            assisting the podling through the Incubation process. The Sponsor is
            therefore expected to be actively involved in the incubation process
            and assist where necessary, giving the podling the best possible
            chance of success. In addition, an entity that is a Top Level Project
            should be involved in the Candidate's incubation in order to educate
            the Candidate about practices that are specific to that TLP and about
            other relevant projects within the TLP.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, while the Sponsor is expected to be actively involved, it is
            formally representated by the Mentors. The Mentors are the individuals
            accountable to the Incubator PMC for ensuring the incubation process
            is correctly followed. In cases where the Mentors are not fulfilling
            their responsibilities, the Sponsor (in particular its Chair) will be
            expected to remedy the situation.

        <section id="Committers">
          <title>Committers
</title>
          <p>The candidate shall declare an initial set of committers. On
acceptance of a candidate project, the assigned Mentors shall be given
access to the Podling's repository for the duration of the
incubation process. This is to allow the Mentors to perform their
incubation duties, and is for administrative purposes only. To be
given full committer privileges, such as the right to add new code to
the repository, the Mentors must earn them as would any other
potential new committer. In some cases, the Mentors may be part of the
initial set of declared committers, but this is not a requirement of
the Incubation process.
</p>
          <p>In association with its Mentor and Champion, a Podling community is
largely free to get on with the stuff they want to do (code,
architecture, product, solutions, etc.) with minimal disruption
related to the incubator process.
</p>
          <p>However, you need to make sure of a number of things:
</p>
          <ul>
            <li>keep your Mentors informed - they are reporting to the PMC and
generally speaking "no news is bad news". Of course, conducting
business on the project's mailing lists is one important way to do
this.
</li>
            <li>make sure your Champion is continuously in-the-loop and has the
latest and greatest information about your project
</li>
            <li>actively seek and recruit committers to your project - preferably
linking you with existing Apache communities
</li>
            <li>make sure your decision making process is visible and accountable
</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These activities are not unique to projects in the Incubator. For
example, existing Apache Projects have regular reports made by their
PMC Chair to the <a href='#board'>Board</a>.
</p>
          <p>During the incubation, the committers will be expected to show how,
as a group, they are upholding the ideals of the Apache community. In
particular, as the Podling evolves it is anticipated that the Podling
will establish procedures for the introduction of new committers
through a process consistent with established Apache practices. If
you are aiming for TLP status you may also want to start on drafting
the policy and procedures you aim to put in place once accepted.
