Dear podling,

During a recent audit of podling websites, your podling was identified as not including the incubating disclaimer.  This disclaimer is required on all podling websites, releases and announcements, to clarify that your project may not be in compliance with all ASF processes.

Please review the Incubator's branding guide: http://incubator.apache.org/guides/branding.html

The full list of observations for all projects can be found at: https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/BrandingAuditJune2016

If you have any questions, feel free to respond to this email or email our general@ mailing list.  Please note that I am not subscribed to your mailing list.
