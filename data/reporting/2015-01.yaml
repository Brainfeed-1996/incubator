    NPanday community seems to be in agreement that retirement is the best
    option at this point. The only outstanding issue before formally
    recommending graduation VOTE is to decide whether there's enough cycles
    available for one last release before retirement.

      Latest Additions:

      * PMC addition:
        * David McLaughlin, 2014-08-20
      * Contributor additions: No additional contributors had code committed
        since the last report, however three new contributors currently have
        code under review that was submitted within the past 6 weeks. At least
        one of these contributions is a large feature addition, which is
        promising.

      Issue backlog status since last report (Oct 1, 2014):

      * Created:   212
      * Resolved:  177

  Brooklyn:
    board-issues:
    community-development: |
      Our community continues to grow slowly but surely, and has received
      interest and contributions from new community members.

      We had the opportunity to talk about our project at ApacheCon Europe
      recently, which has introduced Brooklyn to a wider audience within
      Apache.
    graduation-issues:
      - "Grow the community"
      - "More diversity of the committers/PPMC (currently biased towards employees of a single organization)"
      - "Following up our first release with further, regular, releases"
    project-development: |
      Code continues to be proposed and merged at a high rate. We are
      satisfied with our technical velocity.

      We recently completed our first release as an Apache project, and
      look forward to following this up with regular releases from now on.

        The Brooklyn community is doing very well in learning the rules /
        policies / nuances of working at the ASF. It still needs a bit more time
        to build up a diverse community IMO, but things are looking good.
      ke4qqq: |
        The Brooklyn folks kicked out their first release during this reporting
        cycle, which is an important milestone. Work still remains in terms of
        building a diverse community.
  Calcite:
    board-issues:
    community-development: |
      In December, there were 84 messages on dev@, 45 commits, 50 issues
      created, 27 issues resolved by 7 contributors.

      Julian Hyde gave a talk "SQL on everything, in memory" about Calcite
      at the Strata + Hadoop World conference in October, and held an
      "office hour" with interested community members. He also spoke at
      a Hive meet-up in New York and a Kylin meet-up in San Jose about
      how those projects integrate with Calcite.

      Collaborations are under way with other Apache projects: with Drill
      to make implementation convention more neutral; with Hive for join
      algorithm selection, and leveraging sorted data; and with Phoenix
      to create a Calcite adapter for Phoenix.
    graduation-issues:
      - "Continue to build community"
      - "Add more committers and PPMC members"
      - "Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among multiple project members"
    project-development: |
      We have completed the rename from Optiq to Calcite. We have also
      re-organized the code into the org.apache.calcite namespace. We are
      planning to make a 1.0 release in January with the re-organized
      code.

        This podling is off to a great start.  Mentors are extremely active
        participants with most of the non-Jira chatter being between Dmitriy
        Setrakyan and the mentors; look to the Jira issue to see the rest of the
        community "getting it done".  The "issues to be addressed" section seems
        reasonable.
      brane: |
        I agree with Alan's assessment, but I'd really like to see more
        activity on the dev@ list; especially more of the initial committers
        getting involved in discussions there. Whilst Jira notifications are
        nice, I have a nagging feeling that most of the discussions within
        the community are happening off-line, which leaves a rather large
        hole in the community's collective memory (i.e., mail archives).
        This will have to be addressed before graduation.
  Kalumet:
    board-issues:
    community-development: |
      Apache Kalumet 0.6-incubating version has been released.  However, due to
      some misunderstanding, the release vote has not been completed by 3 IPMC.
      Especially, some legal files issues have been raised.

      We are preparing a 0.6.1-incubating release to fix the legal files and
      submit to IPMC vote.

      We are in the way of promoting the documentation on the website.
    graduation-issues:
    project-development: |
      We are preparing the 0.6.1-incubating (plan for December, 27) to fix the
      legal files issues raised on 0.6-incubating release and have a complete
      IPMC vote.

      We are preparing the 0.7-incubating release with the development changes.

      A new contributor has been identified and started to work on some issues
      and refactoring of the webconsole (mockup provided using Vaadin).

      Local branches have been created containing:

      - new model and REST API
      - new webconsole (remove of Echo framework)

      These local branches will be merged on the 0.7-incubating branch (master).

      Before Graduation:

      - The documentation has been updated and aligned with the 0.6-incubating
        release. The documentation will be promoted on the website and "linked"
        in announcement e-mails as soon as the 0.6.1-incubating release has been
        voted.
      - The 0.7-incubating release will fix the graduation issue, especially in
        term of license (removal of Echo2 framework for the UI).

      Post Graduation:

      - Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept globally
        to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
        deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.

      Kylin meetups at Bay Area and Beijing was well attended.  Apache Kylin has
      been presented at Big Data Technology Conference 2014, Beijing which is
      one of biggest Big Data conference in China.  Interest of people during
      that event was great and engaged a lots of organizations and individuals,
      many of them started to evaluate and joined Kylin community.

         been migrated to Apache Git but need tuning. Main source code migration
         will be done in January 2015.
      2. Bug fixing, enhancement are happing on current branch which
         will be the target v1.0 release.
      3. Work toward next gen version (supports inverted-index) is
         progressing substantially.

      server that continuously checks the integrity of our builds and validates
      our tests.

      The dev mailing list has picked up 20 new e-mails since the last report

      At the suggestion of the community we've adopted a review-then-commit
      strategy which is designed to among other things help with community
      development.

      We've received several patches from members outside the initial committer
      list including changes which dramatically improved our build process and
      provide new extensions.
    graduation-issues:
      - "Produce an initial release."

      All of our current infrastructure needs are setup and things are working
      really well.  Our focus now is on working towards our first release which
      is 0.0.1 and presently comprised of 85 JIRA issues the vast majority of
      which are resolved.  We've conducted a thorough review of all source files
      to ensure proper license headers/notices/disclaimers are present.  We've
      completed a thorough review and modification of the overall LICENSE and
      NOTICE files in preparation for release.  We've conducted the initial
      podling name search and submitted the ticket for that analysis to be
      verified and confirmed.

        NPanday has missed the last two reports (last report August 2014). One
        of two mentors are engaged and encouraging the podling to make a final
        release before retiring (last release was on 2011-05-17). However, there
        is little PPMC/Committer involvement with only 2 PPMC members showing
        involvement on the dev@ list in the past year. Also confirmed that a
        report reminder email was received by the dev@ list for each of the last
        missed reporting periods as well at the current period.

        It's clear that mentors past and present have attempted to help the
        NPanday project grow to a viable size -- at least enough to approve a
        release, new Committer/PPMC Member, or even decide to retire -- without
        success.

        The main warning signs appear to be:

        * Inability to reach community consensus (barely 2 acive Committer/PPMC
          Members, making 3 +1s for any vote very difficult)
        * Inability to perform releases
        * Inability to grow the community to a viable size

        The issues listed above do not indicate a lack of mentor involvement,
        but rather a community in decline.

        being a podling.   We're able to do everything we want to do as a
        podling, have a website, check in code, make releases, etc.   I'm not
        really feeling any urgency from committers or PPMC members to push
        this project through to the next steps needed for graduation.

        Advantages of being a Top Level Project at Apache include:

        1) Less process overhead for releasing.   We still need to check all
        of the items, but we're then trusted to do this on our own without
        additional IPMC review.

        2) Our releases would no longer have the Incubation disclaimer in the
        release notes

        3) We'd get a top level URL for the website odf@apache.org, and a
        shortened mailing list address, dev@odf.apache.org.

        4) We'd have more freedom to do publicity via press releases, etc.

        5) We'd  still need to do quarterly reports, but these would go
        directly to the Apache Board.

        Although none of these by themselves are huge, take together it is a
        nice bundle of perks.   And it really signifies that, as a community,
        we understand The Apache Way, the release procedures and are able to
        sustain the community.

        In our report this month we list the three most important things to do
        on the way to graduation:

        1. Grow the community in terms of committers

        2. Have regular releases

        3. Decide if we would like to be a top level project or join an existing
           project, or move to the attic.


        Any proposals on what we can do for #1 and #2?   For example, do we
        have any contributed patches we still need to integrate?   Are there
        other ways we could think of for publicizing the project, and
        attracting additional volunteers?

        It seems like the project is active in release and code (towards the low activity side).
        However the mailing list traffic and engagement has decreased overtime and the
        dev list even with jira notifications is still very low traffic.

        Ranger suffered a bit from a renaming issue that came up.  Activity on
        the lists is a little bit lighter since, but I'm sure will bounce back.
        I'm concerned over inability to access the wiki though, sent a note to
        the podling to request proper access.

      The project is waiting for the Software Grant from Univ of Manchester
      Solicitor and Contracts Manager as he needed to retrieve the existing CLAs
      from archive.  He has replied (2015-01-05): "They should arrive back from
      storage this week and we can proceed with the [software grant] transfer"

      Taverna's WSDL-support modified to work with Apache Woden.

      About 45% of code base ready to be migrated (moved to slimmer git layout,
      modified to org.apache.taverna groupId and build).
      TODO: LICENSE and NOTICE plugins for Maven.
