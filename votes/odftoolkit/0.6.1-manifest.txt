== Review Items ==========================================================

1.1 Checksums and PGP signatures are valid.
    Reviewers: olira, nick

    Reviewers: robweir (WinXP/Oracle Java 1.7.0_21/Maven 3.0.5)
               olira (MacOS/Oracle Java 1.7.0_21/Maven 3.0.5)
               svanteschubert (Win7/Oracle Java 1.7.0_51/Maven 3.1.1)

3.1 DISCLAIMER is correct, filenames include "incubating".
    Reviewers: olira,robweir

3.2 Top-level LICENSE and NOTICE are correct for each distribution.
    Reviewers: robweir

Comment:  the LICENSE and NOTICE appear in the root of the source archive, but in the META-INF directory of the JAR files 
in the convenience prebuilt JAR and JavaDoc archives.  This ensures that this documentation does not become disassociated
from these packages.


3.3 All source files have license headers where appropriate.
    Reviewers: robweir (built with -Ppedantic flag)

3.4 The provenance of all source files is clear (ASF or software grants).
    Reviewers: robweir 

Comment: Initial check in was of ALv2 code from The ODF Toolkit Union.  We confirmed the contributors to that project
    from the original Mercurial logs:  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/odf/pmc/ip-clearance/contributors.txt)

3.5 Dependencies licenses are ok as per http://apache.org/legal/
    Reviewers: robweir

Note: There are dependencies on the schema definition files for ODF (OASIS) and MathML (W3C). The originating organizations 
permit redistribution but not modification.  So they are not under an open source license.  Based on a legal-discuss
conversation we do not include these files but download them at build time.

See:

3.6 Release consists of source code only, no binaries.
    Reviewers: robweir

Reviewed source archive for files of the following extensions:  JAR, WAR, EXE, COM, GIF, JPG.  None found.

Comment:  There are some binary image files associated with the JavaDoc template, e.g., UML diagrams and similar illustrations.  These were
binary originally, from screen shots, etc.  There is no source version.
